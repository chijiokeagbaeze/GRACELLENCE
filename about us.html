<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white; text-align: center">ABOUT US</h3>
<b style="color: blue;"> GRACELLENCE Resources</b> as a firm was originally involved in Environmental Services, Printing/Publishing and Cyber Café/Business Centre Services only. Later, they extended their services to include Web Design/Development, Digital Marketing, Agency Banking/Bills Payment, Daily Contribution/Thrift Services, Dispatch/Logistics, Laundry/Dry Cleaning, Car Wash, Industrial Cleaning, and Poultry Farming/Agricultural Consultancy, amongst others. In response to Companies and Allied Matters Act 1990 as amended in 2020—pursuant to Section 659—on June 11, 2014 GRACELLENCE Resources was registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission. Prior to registration, the company operated under COPA Engineering Ltd where they were rendering basic services such as Environmental Impact Assessment and Occupational Safety and Health. In spite of the short period of operation, the company has done well in contributing to greening—that is, increasing environmental awareness. They do this through series of researches, sensitizations, consultancy services and partnerships with relevant firms and organizations in ensuring the protection of the ecosystem and compliance with environmental laws and policies. <br>
